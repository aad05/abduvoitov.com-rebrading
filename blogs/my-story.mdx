My name is Asadbek Abduvoitov and I am a software engineer from a small province in Uzbekistan. In this post, I'd like to share a brief account of my journey into the world of programming. Over time, I've gained experience and honed my skills, and I'm excited to reflect on the lessons I've learned along the way. Whether you're just starting out or well on your way to becoming a master coder, I hope my story will inspire you to continue exploring the limitless possibilities of the programming universe.

As you may have seen in the [About](/about) section, my passion for video games was the driving force behind my entry into the world of programming. I was captivated by the immersive worlds and interactive experiences that games could offer, and I wanted to learn how to create those experiences myself. As a kid, I would spend 2-4 hours playing vidoes games on a daily basis. As I continued to play, my passion for the world of gaming only grew stronger. During my youth, I came up with a concept for a game that I called **"Cars valley"**. Options like driving a car, altering, racing, selling, auctioning and even producing the car on your own were available in the game. Looking back, I realize that I spent a total of 1.5 months brainstorming and refining the concept for **"Cars Valley"**. During that time, I thought deeply about the various features and functions that I wanted to include in the game, from the types of vehicles and characters to the different environments and obstacles that players would encounter. Having a ready scheme and a strong passions, I had everything except the answer to the final question **"How to really create a game, to begin with?"**

Back in those days, access to the internet was limited, and we didn't even have a phone that could connect to the web. Being these problems the reason, I completely stopped thinking about creating the game. 4 months passed by, I was close to completing the 7th grade, we were having a conversation with my neighbour and he said that he was learning IT. That was the time when I first heard about IT and naturally, I started questioning. Knowing my passion for games, he talked about the possibility of creating a game through IT and making a lot of money. When my neighbor mentioned the potential for creating games and making money through IT, I was immediately told him that I too wanted to learn IT. At first, I explored the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, and we created our first "Bozorlik Ro'yxati" website. After getting to know the fact that he managed to get into a university and saying that his major was other than IT, he had decided to stop programming. Thus, I was left with not a single opportunity to continue my studies. Although after some time, I coiuld finally make it to the internet using Wi-Fi, I still had no idea what to learn. After hours of researching YouTube videos about programming, I came over Webbrain Academy lessons.

After years of learning, I received my first job offer from my teacher Surely, my first job was not easy, and it is then, I realized the fact that the tecknologies I learned were lacking, and after that I started working nonstop on my skills. The first ever task I took from the company was the ERP project of India. Because the project was huge, I had to revise all of the skills I learned. The following year, I was busy with the company tasks in the afternoons, and learning new skills at noons.

At the end of the day, hard work paid off. Receiving an offer to second job was a blessing. The company was located in the USA, and offered the things like high salary and working remotely. Being busy with my studies, I rejected the job offer and continued working with my mentor. This was a brief journey of mine ðŸ˜Š. Wait for my upcoming posts. Appreciate your interest and look forward to sharing more with you soon!

I want you to know that "It's simple but not easy". With much respect, Asadbek.
